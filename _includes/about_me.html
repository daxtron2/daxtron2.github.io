          I am a 4th year Game Design & Development Major at the Rochester Institute of Techonology.
          I am proficient with both front-end and back-end development, but my true passion lies in
          back-end development for games.

          I enjoy a good challenge. It's one of my favorite parts about being a programmer.
          I love to tackle any programming problem like it's a puzzle or a game, and it allows
          me to come up with solutions relatively easily.
          I'm currently looking for a Software Engineering Co-op in the Rochester, New York Area for Summer and Fall
          2020.

            In February 2020, the game Snoverload was published on Android and iOS. I was the lead developer on this
            project,
            contributing almost the entire code base. It is my first published video game and has been worked on since
            June 2019.
            It was created with C# and Unity.

            Worked on two seperate web development projects for New York State during my Co-op in Spring 2018.
            This covered both the front-end and back-end using C#, ASP.NET MVC 5, JavaScript, Bootstrap.
